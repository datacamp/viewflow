## Straightforward execution of this script
Dependencies are retrieved based on the default pattern: <schema_name>.<table_name>
This enables Viewflow to construct a valid DAG.
However, it's your responsibility to make sure the tables are read from the database!

```{r}
user_emails = select(viewflow.users, c("user_id", "email"))
```
